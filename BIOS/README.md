**Version:** F8

You can see my different settings in the BIOS with the pictures provided in this folder.

## RAM Settings

DON'T use my RAM settings unless you have the same RAM model. I played with the settings to try different overclocking scenarios and couldn't get a pleasant experience running the RAM at 3200Mhz with a 1.35V DRAM Voltage. Therefore, I rollbacked to 3066Mhz which is fine for now.

If you get freezes on your Mac (like system still running in the background but keyboard & mouse get unresponsive for a few seconds/minutes), it is most likely due to the overclocking settings of your RAM. At least it was in my case.
